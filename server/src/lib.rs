//! Feather, a Minecraft server implementation in Rust.
//!
//! This is the developer documenation, and anyone wishing to contribute
//! should read this first.
//!
//! The core of Feather is based on [`legion`](https://github.com/TomGillen/legion),
//! a fast ECS for Rust, and [`tonks`](https://github.com/feather-rs/tonks), a system
//! scheduler built on Legion. As a result, we use the ECS architecture: the
//! entire server consists of _entities_, simple IDs with no data; _components_,
//! arbitrary data, such as positions, which can be attached to an entity;
//! and _systems_, functions which can run logic over entities and components.
//!
//! The benefit of this design is the splitting between data and logic. With a traditional
//! object-oriented design, there would be an Entity class from which other entities
//! inherit and can override logic. However, this model does not work well with Rust's
//! borrow checker (as we found out in the early days of Feather, when this design was
//! used), and more importantly, it reduces flexibility. Say, for example, that a plugin
//! wants to modify the physics behavior of a cow by increasing gravity. With the object-oriented
//! design, it would have to somehow modify the `run_physics` method on `Cow`, which is not
//! possible in a native language (although it can be done in some languages using class rewriting).
//! On the other hand, using Feather, there is a `Physics` component which stores gravity,
//! drag, etc. for an entity, and all the plugin has to do is modify that component.
//!
//! Another benefit of the ECS architecture is performance. With the OO design, entities
//! would likely be stored in a `Vec<Box<dyn Entity>>`, which is horribly inefficient
//! with regards to cache locality and iteration performance. Legion, however, stores
//! entities in an efficient manner such that many of the same type of component
//! are stored contiguously, which is excellent for cache performance.
//!
//! Here is a more in-depth description of each concept in Feather.
//!
//! ## Entities
//! Entities, or `legion::entity::Entity`, are simple numerical IDs: they store no
//! data, but components can be attached to an entity. See the systems section
//! for information on how to access this data.
//!
//! ## Components
//! Components store data associated with an entity, such as `Position`.
//! Arbitrary amounts of components can be associated with any given entity.
//!
//! ## Resources
//! Resources are a branching off from the pure ECS concept. Like components, they
//! store arbitrary data in the form of structs; however, they are not associated
//! with any entity. An example of a resource might be the chunk map, which allows
//! access to blocks in the world.
//!
//! ## Systems
//! The systems concept is where things become more complex. `tonks`, the library
//! which runs systems, runs them _in parallel_, effectively multithreading the
//! entire server. This is still safe because the scheduler ensures that no
//! two systems which write to the same data run at the same time.
//!
//! A consequence of the above is that systems must explicitly state which
//! resources and components they might access. If a system needs access to positions,
//! it needs to state this upfront so the scheduler can ensure memory safety.
//!
//! Systems can be written by creating a function annotated with the `system` attribute.
//! `tonks` will automatically detect which resources are accessed based on the function
//! parameters, and it will register them to the system scheduler without you
//! having to do anything. (How does this work? Don't even bother.)
//!
//! ## Events
//! Events are another concept unique to Feather, at least in the way they are implemented
//! here. The name states what they are—BlockChangeEvent, for example, is triggered when
//! a block is updated.
//!
//! A system can trigger an event by specifying an `&mut Trigger<E>` resource.
//!
//! ## Event handlers
//! Event handlers are similar to systems, but they only run when the event they
//! handle is triggered. Use the `event_handler` attribute on a function to register
//! it as an event handler.
//!
//! # Networking model
//! Feather consists of two key parts: the server threads, which run systems
//! over entities, and the networking tasks, which run on [`tokio`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio).
//! The networking tasks will accept connections and parse any packets received
//! from the player.
//!
//! When a connection is first made to the server's TCP listener, the networking
//! task will spawn another task to handle the connection. It's important to note that
//! at this time, _the server thread is totally unaware of the connection_—networking
//! runs entirely isolated from the rest of the program.
//!
//! At this point, the initial handler takes over, which runs on the networking task.
//! It will handle the login sequence or status pings, perform authentication, etc.
//! If successful, the server is notified of the new player through a channel.
//!
//! When the server is notified of a new player, it's essential to realize
//! that the player still hasn't been sent important data, such as
//! chunk packets, inventory, time, nearby entities, etc. `PlayerJoinEvent`
//! is used to send this data.
