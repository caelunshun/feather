/// this function should be used rather than allocating

/// * `spawn_*` - functions to lazily spawn entities of
/// various types. This avoids the need to specify write
/// storage dependencies for each component the entity
/// needs. Note, however, that the entity isn't created
/// until the handling dispatcher stage. These functions simply
/// redirect to `entity::Spawner`.
