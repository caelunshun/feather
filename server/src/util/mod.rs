/// # Available functions
/// * `alloc` - used to allocate temporary values
/// using a bump allocator. When allocating values
/// which will only be used inside a function, for example,
/// this function should be used rather than allocating
/// directly on the heap.
/// * `spawn_*` - functions to lazily spawn entities of
/// various types. This avoids the need to specify write
/// storage dependencies for each component the entity
/// needs. Note, however, that the entity isn't created
/// until the handling dispatcher stage. These functions simply
/// redirect to `entity::Spawner`.
/// * `broadcast` - lazily broadcasts a packet to all players
/// who are able to see a given chunk. This can be used
/// to broadcast movement updates, for example.
