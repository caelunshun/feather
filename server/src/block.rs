//! Assorted functionality relating to blocks, including:
//! * The block notify system, where a block update "notifies"
//! adjacent blocks of the update. This is used for spawning
//! falling blocks, for example.
//!
//! The block notify system works as follows: when a block
//! is updated, `on_block_update_notify_adjacent` is called,
//! which checks the blocks adjacent to the updated block.
//! For each adjacent block, `notify_entity_for_block` is called
//! which returns an `Option<EntityBuilder>` containing the components
//! to create for the notify entity. For example, `Some(EntityBuilder::new().with(FallingBlockNotify)`
//! could be returned for `Sand` and `Gravel` variants.
//!
//! `on_block_update_notify_adjacent` then creates an entity with those components.
//! The "notify entity," in this case,
//! acts as a sort of event, as other systems can check for these entities
//! and perform actions based on their components.
