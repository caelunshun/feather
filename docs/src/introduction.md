# Introduction

Feather is split into several smaller crates and projects:
- `libcraft` contains data related to Minecraft and which is not directly related to feather.
    - `blocks` contains all data related to Minecraft blocks. 
    - `core` reexports all subcrates and contains data related to Minecraft which is not covered by any other subcrate.
    - `generators` is used to generate `.rs` source files from `prismarinejs/minecraft-data`.
    - `items` contains all data related to Minecraft items.
    - `macros` contains all proc-macros used throughout `libcraft`.
    - `particles` should maybe be moved to core, since it is a single file?
