This is the documentation for the block data files generated by the blocks script.

`feather_blocks`, the crate used by Feather which contains the `Block` enum
and block data structs, reads from `block_data_1.xx.x.dat` files to find
block state ID mappings for a given version. The generator in `generator`
is responsible for generating these files.

The `Block` enum in `feather_blocks` only contains the block types
in the "native" version, currently 1.13.2. This means that only blocks
from the native version are supported, but block state IDs for these
blocks can be found for any version for which block data files are
generated.

The following is the file format used for the block data files.

#### Variable types

* u8, u16, u32, u64 - unsigned integer types, little-endian
* i8, i16, i32, i64 - signed integer types, little-endian
* string - length (u32) followed by `length` UTF-8 bytes'
* boolean - `u8`, either 0 for `false` or 1 for `true`
* array of X - length of array (number of values, not bytes) as a `u32`, followed by `length` X values

#### File format

* Header
    * Raw bytes corresponding to FEATHER_BLOCK_DATA_FILE in ASCII
    * Version name: `string` (e.g. "1.14.4")
    * Protocol version: `u32` (e.g. 498 for 1.14.4)
* State ID mappings
    * Array of struct, stored in order of block types
        * Native block state ID for block: `u16`
        * Block state ID for block in this version: `u16`
