//! The block system used by Feather is a rather
//! complex topic.
//!
//! There are three different sets of block state IDs,
//! native IDs, internal IDs, and versioned IDs.
//!
//! Native IDs are the block state IDs used by the Minecraft
//! version corresponding to Feather's "native" version, 1.13.2.
//! Native IDs are used across the codebaseâ€”for example, the `Chunk`
//! struct in `feather_core` uses native IDs to store blocks.
//!
//! "Internal" IDs are only used inside the `feather_blocks` crate.
//! The benefit of internal IDs is that they are calculated based on
//! the block's data in constant time - there is no need for any sort
//! of lookup. As a result, these internal IDs are used to find versioned and native IDs
//! in a vector. (The internal ID is used as an index into the vector, allowing
//! for efficient constant-time lookup).
//!
//! Versioned IDs mean any set of block state IDs used by Minecraft versions
//! other than the native version (1.13.2). For example, when a Chunk Data packet
//! is sent to a non-native client (e.g. a client on 1.14.4), the block state IDs
//! in the chunk need to be converted to 1.14.4 block state IDs, which may differ
//! from those in the native version. As a result, `feather_blocks` also provides
//! functions to efficiently convert native IDs to versioned IDs.
