# libcraft-generators
This crate contains the generators for all of the autogenerated files in libcraft.

`libcraft-generators` currently provides the following generators:
* Generator for `Biome` enum in `libcraft-core`
* Generator for `BlockKind` enum in `libcraft-blocks`
* Generator for `EntityKind` enum in `libcraft-core`
* Generator for `Item` enum in `libcraft-items` 
* Generator for `SimplifiedBlockKind` enum in `libcraft-blocks`
* Generator for `BlockId` enum in `feather-blocks`
* Generator for the block state lookup table

Data is sourced from multiple sources.
* [`PrimsarineJS/minecraft-data`](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data), which provides the majority
of data. These files live in the `minecraft-data` subdirectory, which is a Git submodule. Make sure
that Git submodules are up to date before running the scripts.
* `libcraft-data` directory contains custom data files, made especially for libcraft.
* `BlockId` generator uses block state data generated by the vanilla minecraft server, which is extracted at runtime
